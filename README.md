# ðŸŽ® Tic Tac Toe (Java OOP | Console-Based)

A simple **2-player Tic Tac Toe game** built in **Java** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
This project runs in the **console/terminal** and allows two human players to compete by taking turns.

---

## âœ¨ Features
- Console-based **3Ã—3 Tic Tac Toe board**  
- Two-player mode (Player X vs Player O)  
- Input validation (no overwriting moves)  
- Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)  
- Draw detection (if the board is full)  
- Simple and modular **OOP design**  

---

## ðŸ›  OOP Concepts Used
- **Classes & Objects** â†’ Organized game structure  
- **Encapsulation** â†’ Board and player data kept private  
- **Abstraction** â†’ Complex logic hidden in methods  
- **Reusability** â†’ Easy to extend (e.g., adding AI player)

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe-java.git
   Game Instructions
   The board is a 3Ã—3 grid.
   Player X always starts first.
   Enter your move by typing the row and column numbers (e.g., 1 2).
   The game checks after every move for:
   Winner (3 in a row/column/diagonal)
   Draw (board is full with no winner)
   The result is displayed in the console.
